abstract = {Microsporidia may cause emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in bumblebees. Two drivers – commercial bumblebees and managed honey bees – have been identified as possible sources of pathogen spillover. In addition, declines in bumblebee populations may have led to lower genetic diversity and subsequent higher susceptibility to infection, enabling microsporidia to increase in prevalence. There is strong evidence for relatively recent increases in the prevalence of Nosema bombi in North America. However, the lack of definitive data on spillover by microsporidia, in North America or elsewhere, makes it difficult to identify the causes of such increases. Phylogenomic studies are urgently needed to identify the global population structure of microsporidia in bumblebees, and thus identify the source of current and future epidemics. },

In amphibians, certain skin-associated bacteria inhibit the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), yet our understanding of host microbial ecology and its role in disease outbreaks is limited. We sampled skin-associated bacteria and Bd from Pyrenean midwife toad populations exhibiting enzootic or epizootic disease dynamics. We demonstrate that bacterial communities differ between life stages with few shared taxa, indicative of restructuring at metamorphosis. We detected a significant effect of infection history on metamorph skin microbiota, with reduced bacterial diversity in epizootic populations and differences in community structure and predicted function. Genome sequencing of Bd isolates supports a single introduction to the Pyrenees and reveals no association between pathogen genetics and epidemiological trends. Our findings provide an ecologically relevant insight into the microbial ecology of amphibian skin and highlight the relative importance of host microbiota and pathogen genetics in predicting disease outcome.},

Sequencing and comparing the genomes of two pathogenic species of Batrachochytrium to those of close saprophytic relatives reveals that pathogenicity is associated with remarkable expansions of protease and cell wall gene families, while divergent infection strategies are linked to radiations of lineage-specific gene families. By comparing the host-pathogen response to infection for both pathogens, we illuminate the traits that underpin a strikingly different immune response within a shared host species. Our results show that, despite commonalities that promote infection, specific gene-family radiations contribute to distinct infection strategies. The breadth and evolutionary novelty of candidate virulence factors that we discover underscores the urgent need to halt the advance of pathogenic chytrids and prevent incipient loss of biodiversity.},

abstract = {1. Foraging range is a key aspect of the ecology of 'central place foragers'. Estimating how far bees fly under different circumstances is essential for predicting colony success, and for estimating bee-mediated gene flow between plant populations. It is likely to be strongly influenced by forage distribution, something that is hard to quantify in all but the simplest landscapes; and theories of foraging distance tend to assume a homogeneous forage distribution. 2. We quantified the distribution of bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. foragers away from experimentally positioned colonies, in an agricultural landscape, using two methods. We mass-marked foragers as they left the colony, and analysed pollen from foragers returning to the colonies. The data were set within the context of the 'forage landscape': a map of the spatial distribution of forage as determined from remote-sensed data. To our knowledge, this is the first time that empirical data on foraging distances and forage availability, at this resolution and scale, have been collected and combined for bumblebees. 3. The bees foraged at least 1.5 km from their colonies, and the proportion of foragers flying to one field declined, approximately linearly, with radial distance. In this landscape there was great variation in forage availability within 500 m of colonies but little variation beyond 1 km, regardless of colony location. 4. The scale of B. terrestris foraging was large enough to buffer against effects of forage patch and flowering crop heterogeneity, but bee species with shorter foraging ranges may experience highly variable colony success according to location. {\textcopyright} 2007 Rothamsted Research.},

While threats to bees are numerous, few analyses have attempted to understand the relative importance of multiple stressors. Such analyses are critical for prioritizing conservation strategies. Here, we describe a landscape analysis of factors predicted to cause bumblebee declines in the USA. We quantified 24 habitat, land-use and pesticide usage variables across 284 sampling locations, assessing which variables predicted pathogen prevalence and range contractions via machine learning model selection techniques. We found that greater usage of the fungicide chlorothalonil was the best predictor of pathogen (Nosema bombi) prevalence in four declining species of bumblebees. Nosema bombi has previously been found in greater prevalence in some declining US bumblebee species compared to stable species. Greater usage of total fungicides was the strongest predictor of range contractions in declining species, with bumblebees in the northern USA experiencing greater likelihood of loss from previously occupied areas. These results extend several recent laboratory and semifield studies that have found surprising links between fungicide exposure and bee health. Specifically, our data suggest landscape-scale connections between fungicide usage, pathogen prevalence and declines of threatened and endangered bumblebees.},

abstract = {Crithidia bombi is a prevalent endoparasite of bumblebees that is transmitted both horizontally between and vertically within colonies of its host, the bumble bee Bombus terrestris, and to the next generation. By experimentally infecting or not infecting laboratory-raised colonies with a standard inoculum before their transfer to the field, this study was aimed at evaluating the level of virulence of C. bombi under natural conditions. However, an unexpected finding was a substantial and seasonal increase in infections of natural populations, such that all colonies quickly became infected once exposed to the field. On average, experimentally infected colonies showed positive signs of infection 9.5 days after being exposed, not different from the 11.7 days in untreated colonies. Not surprisingly therefore, no significant differences between the two experimental groups in measures of colony success, such as male and young queen production or time of emergence of sexuals, were found. Overall though, C. bombi showed low levels of virulence which fits recent models for parasites with correlated horizontal and vertical transmission rates. On the other hand, the number of sexuals produced depended on the length of time over which reproduction could be sustained. Thus, early colonies and those with large first brood and large maximum size were at an advantage. Also, strong effects of site occurred. In addition, many colonies became naturally infected with the microsporidian Nosema bombi. Such infections were not associated with experimental treatment or colony size, but correlated with an increased production of sexuals, particularly males.},

To date its pathology and impact on host fitness are not well understood. We performed a laboratory experiment investigating the pathology and fitness effects of this parasite on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We experimentally infected one group of colonies with N. bombi spores at the start of the worker production, while a second uninfected group of colonies served as controls. During colony development we collected live workers for dissections to measure infection intensities. In parallel, we measured several life history traits, to investigate costs to the host. We succeeded in infecting 11 of 16 experimental colonies. When infection occurred at an early stage of colony development, virtually all individuals were infected, with spores being found in a number of tissues, and the functional fitness of males and young queens was reduced to zero. Further, the survival of workers from infected colonies and infected males were reduced. With such severe effects, N. bombi appears to decrease its opportunities for transmission to the next host generation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The present study investigates whether N. bombi also has negative fitness effects under natural conditions. 2. A field experiment was conducted with B. terrestris spring queens caught from the wild. In the laboratory these queens were assigned to either infected or control treatment groups. On the emergence of workers, colonies were placed in the field and a number of fitness and life-history traits were measured. 3. The size of colonies produced by infected queens was significantly smaller than those of control queens. None of the 14 infected colonies produced sexual offspring, whereas four of the 14 control colonies reached the male production stage. Results of the field experiment are in agreement with prior laboratory-based results, and even imply that such effects are amplified under natural conditions. 4. The evidence suggests that, on entering the colony early, N. bombi has a highly detrimental effect on the fitness of its host.

Parasite success was highest when infecting colonies where larval exposure to the parasite was high. The later individual bees were born in the colony life-cycle, the higher their infection intensity, but after eclosion individual parasite loads did not increase, indicating either host control of the parasite, a balance between internal infection and the production of transmission stages, or a switch in the parasite's growth strategy after eclosion to the production of transmission stages.

We compare current and historical distributions of eight species, compiling a database of {\textgreater}73,000 museum records for comparison with data from intensive nationwide surveys of {\textgreater}16,000 specimens. We show that the relative abundances of four species have declined by up to 96{\%} and that their surveyed geographic ranges have contracted by 23-87{\%}, some within the last 20 y. We also show that declining populations have significantly higher infection levels of the microsporidian pathogen Nosema bombi and lower genetic diversity compared with co-occurring populations of the stable (nondeclining) species. Higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are, thus, realistic predictors of these alarming patterns of decline in North America, although cause and effect remain uncertain.},

abstract = {1. It is generally thought that the intensification of farming will result in higher disease prevalences, although there is little specific modelling testing this idea. Focussing on honeybees, we build multi‐colony models to inform how “apicultural intensification” is predicted to impact honeybee pathogen epidemiology at the apiary scale. 2. We used both agent‐based and analytical models to show that three linked as- pects of apicultural intensification (increased population sizes, changes in popula- tion network structure and increased between-colony transmission) are unlikely to greatly increase disease prevalence in apiaries. Principally this is because even low‐intensity apiculture exhibits high disease prevalence. 3. The greatest impacts of apicultural intensification are found for diseases with relatively low R0 (basic reproduction number), however, such diseases cause little overall disease prevalence and, therefore, the impacts of intensification are minor. Furthermore, the smallest impacts of intensification are for diseases with high R0 values, which we argue are typical of important honeybee diseases. 4. Policy Implications: Our findings contradict the idea that apicultural intensification by crowding honeybee colonies in large, dense apiaries leads to notably higher disease prevalences for established honeybee pathogens. More broadly, our work demon- strates the need for informative models of all agricultural systems and management practices in order to understand the implications of management changes on diseases.},
